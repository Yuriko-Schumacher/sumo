                    <p>
                        In this project, I am analyzing Japanese Sumo
                        wrestling's

                        >
                        to see what kind of wrestlers are at the top of the
                        rankings.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Purpose of the project</h2>
                    <p>
                        I am analyzing this data because I have been asked about
                        Sumo so much since I moved to the US (since I am from
                        Japan), but I wasn't able to answer the questions very
                        well. In fact, I have never watched a Sumo match in
                        person. Through this project, I would like to learn more
                        about Sumo wrestling, as well as be able to answer
                        questions about the sport.
                    </p>
                    <h2>A little bit about Sumo</h2>
                    <img

                    <p>
                        Sumo (相撲) is full-contact wrestling where two
                        wrestlers (力士,
                        <i>rikishi</i>) grapple and attempt to push or throw
                        their opponent. The winner is the one who forces the
                        opponent out of the ring or into touching the ground
                        with any part of their body other than their feet.
                        Generally, heavier wrestlers tend to be ranked higher
                        since they are harder to move.

                    <p>
                        In Japan, Sumo is practiced professionally as a national
                        sport. Japan usually holds
                        <a

                        six times a year, and each tournament has its own
                        tournament ranking table.

                    <p>
                        There are about 700 wrestlers in total, and they are
                        grouped into six divisions based on rank. The top 42
                        wrestlers are part of a group known as "幕内,
                        <i>makuuchi</i>".

                    <h1>Data analysis</h1>
                    <p>
                        For this project, I am comparing the data for top 42
                        wrestlers over 20 years, quinquennially. I am analyzing
                        January's tournament data for each year.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        First, I am visualizing the top 42 wrestlers' weight and
                        height, as well as their place of birth and ranking. I
                        am also creating a second visualization that shows the
                        number of wrestlers for each age and their countries of
                        birth and ranks, over the years. These analyses were
                        motivated by the following questions:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <b>Are Mongolian wrestlers really strong?</b> I hear
                            many strong wrestlers are from Mongolia, so I would
                            like to know if this is true.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>The taller/heavier, the better?</b> I would like
                            to know if there is a correlation between the
                            wrestler's height/weight and their rank.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>What's the best age for sumo wrestlers?</b> As
                            much as sumo is a physical sport, I know there are
                            many wrestlers in their late 30s who are ranked high
                            in Makuuchi division. I'd like to know the general
                            tendency in terms of wrestler's age and rank.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        I conducted the initial analysis using R. The original
                        data sets are seperated by the years, and each has
                        rankings for all six tournaments held in that year.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Therefore, for each year's data, I filtered the rows to
                        only show January's top 42 wrestlers, and then combined
                        the five seperated data sets. I also converted kilograms
                        into pounds, centimeters into feet, and birth dates into
                        ages (as of the time each tournament table was
                        published).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The cleaned data has 210 rows and 12 columns. Each row
                        represents a wrestler. The columns are as follows:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>

                            <b>age</b>: The wresler's age (as of the time the
                            tournament table was published)

                    <h1>Visualization</h1>
                    <p>
                        Here, I'm creating two data visualizations. The first
                        visualization shows 1) where the topmost wrestlers are
                        from, and tires to find out 2) if taller/heavier
                        wrestlers are higher-ranked, over two decades. The
                        second one demonstrates how many wrestlers were at what
                        age on the top 42 tournament table over time.
                    </p>
                    <h2>1. Relationships between height/weight and rank</h2>
                    <p>
                        For the first visualization, I created a scatter plot.
                        Inside the scatter plot, each circle represents a
                        wrestler in the Makuuchi (top 42) division. The x-axis
                        shows the wrestler's weight in lbs, while the y-axis
                        shows the wrestler's height in feet. The color shows the
                        wrestler's rank (from 1 to 42). The circle(s) with
                        yellow strokes represent wrestlers from Mongolia, in
                        order to distinguish them easily since one of the
                        questions I'm trying to answer is if Mongolian wrestlers
                        are stronger in general.

                    <p>
                        By clicking the buttons from January 1999 to January
                        2019, you can select which year's data to show. The
                        original chart shows data for January 1999.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There is also a filter feature that can apply to each
                        year's visualization. By clicking the checkboxes, you
                        can filter the wrestlers by whether they are from Japan,
                        Mongolia, or other countries. At the same time, you can
                        change the minumum and maximum ranks of the wrestlers
                        shown. If you change the data's year, the filter feature
                        will reset automatically and the scatter plot will have
                        42 circles to show.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In any of the state, you can see a wrestler's detailed
                        information in a tooltip by hovering over a circle.

                    <h2>Findings from the visualization</h2>
                    <p>The visualization demonstrates a few facts:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Although there are occasional outliers, most of the
                            Makuuchi wrestlers weigh around 280 ~ 400 pounds.
                            Conversely, we can't see any strong tendencies of
                            their height.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            It's not necessarily true that the taller/heavier
                            the wrestlers are, the stronger. For example, in
                            January 1999, <b>Wakanohana</b> (5'11", 289lbs) is
                            ranked 2nd, whereas <b>Akebono</b> (6'8", 501lbs)
                            and <b>Musashimaru</b>
                            (6'3", 474lbs) are ranked 3rd and 4th respectively.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            More and more Mogolian wrestlers are coming into the
                            Makuuchi division over the two decades. The numbers
                            of Mongolian wrestlers increase from 1 (January
                            1999) → 4 → 9 → 10 → 6 (January 2019). The rumor --
                            that Mongolian wrestlers are generally strong --
                            appears to be only true in recent years. Still, most
                            Makuuchi wrestlers are Japanese over all.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>2. Makuuchi wrestler's age distribution</h2>
                    <p>
                        Next, I'm going to visualize how many wreslers are at
                        what age in the Makuuchi (top 42) division.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Similar to the first chart, each circle represents a
                        wrestler, and the circle's color represents the
                        wrestler's rank (1 to 42). Mongolian wrestlers are
                        highlighted as yellow.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The x-axis shows the wrestler's age (when the tournament
                        table was published), and the y-axis shows the number of
                        wrestlers at each age. By selecting the button on top
                        (from January 1999 to January 2019), you can select
                        which year's data to show. Originally, the visualization
                        represents the data for January 1999.

                    <p>The visualization demonstrates a few facts:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Many high-ranked Makuuchi wrestlers are late 20s and
                            early 30s. Younger and older wrestlers occasionally
                            do well, such as <b>Asashoryu</b> (from January
                            2004, age: 23, rank: 1), and <b>Kaio</b> (from
                            January 2009, age: 36, rank: 6).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Kyokutenho</b> (from January 2014, age: 39, rank:
                            39) was an unusually old wrestler to be registered
                            in the Makuuchi division.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            You can find many wrestlers who stay in the Makuuchi
                            division over the years such as
                            <b>Chiyotaikai</b> (from January 2004, age: 27,
                            rank: 3 / from January 2009, age: 32, rank: 4) and

                                href="http://www.sumo.or.jp/EnSumoDataRikishi/profile/2320/index.php/"
                                target="_blank"
                                ><b>Hakuho</b></a
                            >
                            (from January 2009, age: 23, rank: 1 / from January
                            2014, age: 28, rank: 2 / from January 2019, age: 33:
                            rank: 2). Those wrestlers are the most successful
                            ones who stay atop over many years throughout their
                            career.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        From these findings, it can be said that elements like
                        wrestler's height/weight, place of birth, and age matter
                        to a certain degree, but there seem to be many more
                        factors that break the general tendency and determine
                        their sumo-wrestling skills.
